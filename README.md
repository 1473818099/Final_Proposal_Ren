Title: 
Fantasy Dungeon by Unity-3D (Game)

3 resources:
Github copilot – as a helping tool
Learning resources in Youtube for 3D game editor basics
General Assests

A paragraph:
This game is based on Unity editor 6 – Universal 3D (URP). This will be a gun shotting game. The player might have multiple abilities that can affect the game. The main art concept haven’t defined yet. All the functions operated by Unity and I will write the script for each layer.

Project overlap:
No. However, I am mainly focus on sound design for game and I am taking MTEC-321 with Prof. Spencer Bambrick next semester. I guess this project would be help in the future.

Accomplishment no matter what:
The game basic function will work fine. For example, functioning player/enemy movement, gun shot function set, damage system, health system, basic scene. 

Accomplishment with better outcome:
Extension functions for players abilities.

Accomplishment with best outcome:
Wonderful art concept, no bugs for physical system and models. Player won’t run out of the map. (Hope)
